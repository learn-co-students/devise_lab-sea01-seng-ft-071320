# Devise: Setup and customization

Set up a Rails server with [Devise] to let users log in with a username and
password.

## Objectives

We're going to use Devise and Rails to create an app with a complete sign-in
flow. For the most part, we will be able to do this using only generators. This
is one of the compelling reasons people use Rails: it's a universe full of
solved problems that can be rapidly deployed.

## Instructions: Part 1, Setup

Typically you would need to add [Devise] to your `Gemfile`:

    gem 'devise'

We've already done that for you :)

Run `bundle install`.

Now run the installer:

    rails generate devise:install

This comes purely from the [Devise] documentation. We're just following
instructions.

This creates a massive initializer in `config/initializers/devise.rb`.

You'll notice that the installer prints a big notice of several things you
should do. In particular, we should have a root route.

Create a `WelcomeController` with a `home` action and a view that just prints
`current_user.email`. Generate the controller and the action.

Now generate your `User` model with:

    rails g devise User

Run `rails routes`. You should see that Devise has added a bunch of routes.

Run `rails db:migrate`.

## From Devise to Server Rules

Our goal is to connect our app to Facebook. Normally we would want to test our
our server by running `rails server` here. Facebook requires that sites that
communicate with them be secured by HTTPS, the same style of connection that's
used when you browser your bank accounts on-line. The default `rails server`
**does not** run with that security in place.  We have forced this lab to run
with security in place so that you can connect to Facebook. That means that if
you start Rails with `rails server` and try to visit
`http://localhost:3000/users/sign_up`, you will get an error:

```text
This site canâ€™t provide a secure connection

localhost sent an invalid response.
```

We need to set up our server to work with HTTPS. This is a tangent from
"getting authentication from Facebook working" in the strict sense, but this is
absolutely a challenge real developers face every day. You think you have a
handle on something and then a third party changes things and you have to do
some weird, complex, and new-to-you work to get things working again.

To get Rails running securely we need:

1. A certificate
2. A key
3. A new way to start the Rails server securely

### Generate the Key and Certificate

Key and certificate generation is a complex field.  We're going to give you a
command to generate your own key and certificate. Do not add these with `git`.
These are not secure. These are sufficient for testing.

You will need the `openssl` command installed on your system.

Run the `openssl` command.

```shell
$ openssl req -x509 -sha256 -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 -days 365 -keyout devise_lab_localhost.key -out devise_lab_localhost.crt
```

This will start generating some cryptographic resources for your server to use.
You'll be asked to fill in some organizational data. We put some in for fun:

```text
openssl req -x509 -sha256 -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 -days 365 -keyout
devise_lab_localhost.key -out devise_lab_localhost.crt
Generating a 2048 bit RSA private key
............................................................................+++
................+++
writing new private key to 'devise_lab_localhost.key'
-----
You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
into your certificate request.
What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
For some fields there will be a default value,
If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.
-----
Country Name (2 letter code) []:us
State or Province Name (full name) []:ny
Locality Name (eg, city) []:nyc
Organization Name (eg, company) []:testing
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:justtesting
Common Name (eg, fully qualified host name) []:reallytesting
Email Address []:nobody@example.com
```

We can verify the files were created with:

```shell
$ ls devise_lab_localhost.key devise_lab_localhost.crt
```

Lastly, let's start the Rails server with these "dummy" files.

```shell
$ rails server -b 'ssl://localhost:3000?key=devise_lab_localhost.key&cert=devise_lab_localhost.crt'
```

At long last, we can **now** go to `https://localhost:3000/users/sign_up`.
You'll be given an error (because the authority of this certificate was you,
not someone official). Click the "Advanced" button and "Proceed to localhost
(unsafe)." At _very_ long last, you'll see that Rails is working!

OK, now that our communication path to Facebook will work, let's get Facebook
authentication working.

## Part 2, Customization

Now let's add Facebook login support with [Omniauth].

Add the `omniauth-facebook` gem to your Gemfile:

    gem 'omniauth-facebook'

Run `bundle install` after.

Since we're going to allow users, modeled by the `User` class to log in with
another authentication system, we need to store some more data about those
users in our `users` table in _our_ database. This means we need to write a
migration.

We'll need to store two more columns in our user model: a `provider` `String`
(which will always be `'facebook'` or `nil` in our app for the moment; you
might imagine `'google'` or `'github'` might be other options), and a `uid`,
the user's authenticated Facebook ID.

```shell
rails g migration AddOmniauthToUsers provider:index uid:index
rails db:migrate
```

### Configuring Omniauth for Facebook Use

We need to add the [Omniauth] configuration to `config/initializers/devise.rb`:

    config.omniauth :facebook, ENV['FACEBOOK_KEY'], ENV['FACEBOOK_SECRET']

This tells [Omniauth] how to log _our application_ in to Facebook so that we
can use it for _our_ users' authentication.  What's actually happening here is
we're invoking a method called `config.omniauth` with  parameters for the
method are something like:

    config.omniauth(third-party-authentication-service, login, password)

To confuse things further, instead of just passing in an actual login like
`"example-key"` or a password like `"super-secret-p@ssW()rD!' to
`config.omniauth`, we're passing in references to keys from a hash called
`ENV`. What's going on with this?

As you might recall from learning about the command-line environment, there are
a number of variables that can be set in the shell. When those variables are
set, programs launched from within the shell inherit those variables.  We use
the shell command `export` to define a variable in a shell. When a program is
run from that shell, particularly `rails`, it takes those environment variables
and puts them in a globally-accessible `Hash` called `ENV`.

> ***IMPORTANT**: Keep in mind, your Rails server ***must be run from a shell
> with set ENV variables***. Use the command `env` to see what your environment
> variables are.  If you don't see the environment variables you expect, Rails
> won't see them either.

So all this explanation and code comes down to this: We write important data to
shell environment variables and we pass those variables' special information to
`config.omniauth`.

This might sound confusing, but the alternative would be to store our login key
and our login password within `config/initializers/devise.rb`. If we did that,
when we pushed our code to GitHub, **anyone in the world could harvest our
identity**. In fact, research shows that there are bots crawling GitHub
***right now*** searching for people having made these mistakes.

## Getting a `FACEBOOK_KEY` and `FACEBOOK_SECRET`

To set things up with `config.omniauth`, we need to get the `FACEBOOK_KEY` and
`FACEBOOK_SECRET` values.

_Keep in mind, the Facebook UI may change subtly over time._

Create an application in the [Facebook developer console][fbdev] and get these
values from there. You'll also need to go to +Add Product in the sidebar menu
on the left. This will bring you to the Product Setup page. Here click 'get
started' for Facebook Login and set Valid OAuth Redirect URLs that point to
your application.

We might expect that we could provide URLs like:

`https://<YOUR_SERVER_ADDRESS>/users/auth/facebook/callback`

Which would typically be exemplified by:

`https://localhost:3000/users/auth/facebook/callback`

This setting is listed under `Client OAuth Settings` in the dashboard.

Confusingly, `FACEBOOK_KEY` is called appId in their console. Set the values in
your shell in which you run `thin` like so (you might need to CTRL+C out of
`thin` first):

    export FACEBOOK_KEY=your_app_id
    export FACEBOOK_SECRET=your_app_secret

To make these changes permanent, we can either update our command-line setup
code (our `~/.bashrc`) or we can make use of the [dotenv] gem. We'll not cover
those here, but dotenv stores these variables in a file (`.env`) that Rails
automatically reads on startup.

Add this line to your `user.rb` to enable omniauth:

    devise :omniauthable, :omniauth_providers => [:facebook]

And add this line to your welcome view:

     <%= link_to "Sign in with Facebook", user_facebook_omniauth_authorize_path %>

If you visit the welcome page and click "Sign in with Facebook," you should be
able to go through a Facebook application authorization flow.

When you return to your app, you'll be greeted with an error: `The action
'facebook' could not be found for Devise::OmniauthCallbacksController`. Okay,
let's make one.

Add this to `routes.rb` to create a route for Omniauth to send its
authentication data to:

    devise_for :users, :controllers => { :omniauth_callbacks => "users/omniauth_callbacks" }

Now add a file `app/controllers/users/omniauth_callbacks_controller.rb`:

    class Users::OmniauthCallbacksController < Devise::OmniauthCallbacksController
      def facebook
        # TODO
      end
    end

The action should have the same name as the provider. In this case, Facebook.

Now we have to write some code to handle the code [Omniauth] got back from
Facebook.

    def facebook
      @user = User.from_omniauth(request.env["omniauth.auth"])
      sign_in_and_redirect @user
    end

We have to write the `User.from_omniauth` method ourselves.

    class User < ActiveRecord::Base
      def self.from_omniauth(auth)
        where(provider: auth.provider, uid: auth.uid).first_or_create do |user|
          user.email = auth.info.email
          user.password = Devise.friendly_token[0,20]
        end
      end
    end

Here we look for a user with that (`provider: :facebook, uid: your_uid`) pair
and create them if they aren't in the database. For Facebook users, we create a
random password. The expectation is that users logging in with Facebook don't
subsequently want to set a password.

You should now see a missing template error. But wait, didn't we say `sign_in_and_redirect`? Where are we being redirected to?

It turns out that Devise doesn't know automatically. We have to write a method in our `ApplicationController`:

    def after_sign_in_path_for(resource)
      request.env['omniauth.origin'] || root_path
    end

## Part 3, Displaying Errors

We have a basic sign-up, sign-in, and sign-out flows setup with Facebook login!
There is just one problem though. When a visitor has an incorrect login
attempt, no feedback is given!  Since creating custom views for each view is a
bit of a pain (feel free to try it from the docs [here][custom-layouts]) we are
simply going to use a simple hack.

Devise adds all the messages it wants to display in the `flash` hash that is
available to our views. Since we do not have any intense CSS going on we can
simply add the following code to our `application/application.html.erb` file
before the `<body>` tag's call to `<%= yield %>`.

```erb
<%- flash.each do |name, msg| -%>
  <%= content_tag :div, msg, :id => "flash_#{name}" if msg.is_a?(String) %>
<%- end -%>
```

This will display _all_ flash messages at the top of each page. This allows us
to present failure information to the user without overriding the Devise
templates. For more full implementations we'd build a series of custom views,
but for the purpose of understanding [Omniauth]'s third-party sign-up
capabilities, it's sufficient.

If you **do** want to go so far as to take over the management of the [Devise]
views, you need to get [Devise] to put them "into" your Rails application so
that you have files to edit. To do this you're going to need to use [Devise]'s
`devise:views` generator. The [documentation][Devise] describes this workflow.

## Lab Spec Notes

1. To pass all the tests you will need to create a `/about` route, view and
   controller (under `WelcomeController`) to display a simple about page.
2. Passwords must be 6 characters or longer (you can achieve this with a length
   validation on `:password` in the `User` model with [Devise])

## Hiccups

If Devise doesn't seem able to get an email from Facebook, you may have to
de-authorize and re-authorize your application in your Facebook privacy
settings.

This is a complex lab with a lot of moving pieces to get right! It might take
some careful reading of the Rails console output to get everything working.
